                For this competition we created a prototype of Hyperloop. We made a hyperloop pod out of lego ev3 mindstorms.
                <br> We futher created edge node devices powered by arduino which give us specific information required for the maintainance of the transport.
                <br> We integrated IOT with sensors in the pods and on the track for safe transport and intelligent collision avoidance.

                <u><b> World Robotics Olympaid </b></u>
                <br><br>
                For this competition we created a prototype of aquaponics based on the full scale facility of our school.
                <br>We took the science further by integrating the system with IOT powered by arduino to measure rubricks such as soil temperature, moisture in the soil etc.
                <br>This way we are able to grow the plant and full fill its need autonomously.

                <br><br>
                For this competition I created a drone and a smart rover.
                <br>The drone was to be manually controlled. While the smart rover supported both autonomous mode and manual mode.
