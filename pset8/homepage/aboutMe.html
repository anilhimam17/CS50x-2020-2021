        <!-- About Me -->
        <p class="normText">
        	Hello World I am Anil Himam. <b><u>All my childhood have grown up watching Iron man films</u></b> thats the reason I have chosen technology as my career.<br><br>

        	Further I want to highlight the fact that <b><u>I like tinkering with things to try and understand the principal of how anything works</u></b>. This has always been the way I learnt anything since my childhood <u><b>to not just understand a concept but to use its principals to create something</b></u>.<br><br>

        	In this process of experiential learning I have achieved some small goals which are as follows.

        	<!-- Beginning of the ordered list -->
        	<ol class="normText">
        		<li>
        			<u><b> Building STEM Projects </b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    I have built many STEM projects for different competitions including the CBSE National Level STEM fair, World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) and High School Science Fair.
                    <br><br>
        		</li>

        		<li>
        			<u><b> Learning to Program computers </b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    I am mostly self taught when it comes to computer programming. The first languauge I learnt was SWIFT.
                    I was taught the fundamentals of python in high school after which I have learnt its applications on my own. Thanks to cs50x I have also learnt Javascript, HTML, CSS and C programming.

        		<li>
                    <u><b> Working on Robotics Projects </b></u>
        			<br><br>
                    To work on robotics projects I have learnt how to use arduino and lego ev3. Most of the projects I hve worked on are using the mentioned equiment.

        		<li>
        			<u><b> Taking courses on Artificial Intelligence </b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    I am also pursing my interest towards Artificial Intelligence by taking courses offered by Harvard. I have always been interested in Artificial Intelligence due to Iron Man movies.

                    <u><b> Sports </b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    I am an athelete. I have participated in inter and intra school sports competitions.
                    <br>I also like the concept of endurance and stamina for which I have participated in marathons
                    <br>for the rane of 5km and 10km.

                    <u><b> Dancing and Music </b></u>
                    <br><br>
                    I like to dance and listen to music in my leisure time. I find that music is a great way to destress from the problems we face in our daily lives.

                    <br><br>
                    Lastly I love to test my brain in criticial situations, this is the reason I like programming.
                    <br>I always try and find time to solve problems of different kinds be it puzzles or anything.
