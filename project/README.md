# BVS ELECTIONS

Hello, world this is my final project for the course CS50 offered by Harvard University.

Election Ready is a software which I have designed to digitise the election held in my school.
This software clearly analyses the needs of the student council elections that are held annually in my school.
The software is Flask Web - application written in PYTHON, HTML, CSS and SQL.

The software is divided into two sections which are as follows:
1) Administrator Controls:
   The functions provided in this section are used to create elections, update the list of nominees,
   view the status of elections at an instant, attain the results of the elections automatically and lastly
   reset all the information for the organising a new election.

2) Student Controls:
   This section consists of the interface provided to students to vote for their leaders. It contains a set of
   dropdown menus showing all the nominees standing for a given position.

The key idea behind designing this software is the ease of use.
This was my final-project.
